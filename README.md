# Neuron
Neuron is a full featured action Bar addon for [World of Warcraft: Shadowlands](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/), updated for Patch 9.0.5


## Manual Install:
I do not recommend downloading this addon directly from Github, as there are CurseForge packaging modifications made to the addon upon release. These modifications include updating all included libraries to their latest release versions and pulling in all of the crowd sourced localizations. I have made an effort to pull in periodic samplings of these, but what you will find in the packaged versions on CurseForge or WowInterface will be much more up to date.


## Want to Donate?
Making add-ons is a lot of work! Your help goes a huge way to making my add-on work possible. If you would like to Donate, [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/brittyazel "Sponsor Me") is the preferred method as they are currently matching donations dollar for dollar and take zero cut.


## Translating
The efforts to translate Neuron into many languages is a community project, and it could use your help!

## Download:
The addon can be downloaded at these places:
* **[Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neuron)** 
* **[Curseforge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/neuron)**
* **[WowInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info10636-Neuron.html)**


## Development:
Neuron development is all done using the **[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** Community Edition IDE and with the assistance of the fantastic **[EmmyLua](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9768-emmylua)** plugin. Detailed instructions on how I set up my development environment can be found **[here](https://github.com/Ellypse/IntelliJ-IDEA-Lua-IDE-WoW-API/wiki)**. Likewise, in game I make use of the addons **[BugGrabber](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber)**, **[BugSack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack)**, and **[ViragDevTool](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/varrendevtool)**, and in game tools such as **"/eventtrace"** and **"/framestack"**

Development of Neuron requires an understanding of **[Lua syntax](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html)**, the **[WoW API](https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_API)**, and a working understanding of Git/GitHub. If you want to help with Neuron's development, I suggest: 
1. Forking the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/brittyazel/Neuron) (some people use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), but I personally use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/))
2. Setting up your aforementioned development environment
3. Backing up your WTF folder
4. [Symlinking](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/) your cloned Neuron git folder to your "World of Warcraft>\_retail_>Interface>Addons" folder
5. Making your first change

A good place to start coding is by looking through the **[issue tracker](https://github.com/brittyazel/Neuron/issues)** to find any issues marked as "[good first issue](https://github.com/brittyazel/Neuron/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)". All code change submissions should come in the form of pull requests, so that I can review it and provide comments before merging.



### Disclaimer:

Neuron is a fork of the amazing *Ion Action Bars* addon started by Connor H. Chenoweth. All credit for the work done prior to 2017 should go to him, accordingly.
